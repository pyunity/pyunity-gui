This is a pure Python editor to make PyUnity projects (see https://github.com/pyunity/pyunity).
PyUnity is a pure Python Game Engine that is only inspired by Unity and not bindings for Unity,
therefore this Editor is completely separate, but inspired by the UnityEditor.

## Installing

The PyPi package does not work with the latest releases of PyUnity, and as such the best way
to use this editor is to clone this editor and regularly run `git pull` to update. From the repo,
running `python -m editor ProjectPath/` will work. To create a new project, run
`python -m editor --new ProjectPath/`.
