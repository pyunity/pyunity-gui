This is a pure Python editor to make PyUnity projects (see https://github.com/pyunity/pyunity).
PyUnity is a pure Python Game Engine that is only inspired by Unity and not bindings for Unity,
therefore this Editor is completely separate, but inspired by the UnityEditor.

## Installing

The PyUnity Editor can be installed via pip:

    > pip install pyunity-editor

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to build the package from source. These builds are sometimes broken, so use at your own risk. You can build as follows:

    > git clone https://github.com/pyunity/pyunity-gui
    > git checkout master
    > python setup.py install

Its only dependencies are PyUnity, PyQt5 and Pillow. Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools are required on Windows for building PyUnity from source (if there isn't a wheel available). The PyUnity Editor requires a PyUnity version of at least 0.7.1.

## Running
To run the PyUnity Editor, you run this command from the terminal:

    > pyunity-editor project/

where `project/` is your project folder. The PyUnity Editor will launch with a splash screen, then the editor window will appear.
